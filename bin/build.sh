# this script assumes SBCL at multiple places. ideally it should use
# cl-launch, but see Fare's thoughts below (from around 2014):
#
# Quick answer: cl-launch could help indeed, though it might need some love.
#
# A few things cl-launch 4 will do for you:
# * abstract over implementation. More useful if you're on Windows or
# ARM, where SBCL support is not as good and you'll want CCL instead.
# * manage the painful loading of asdf and uiop and quicklisp — note
# that any version of ASDF good enough for cl-launch 4 will have UIOP.
# * let you easily specify --system hu.dwim.logger --system
# maru+hu.dwim.logger --system swank --file setup.lisp, etc.
# * (via UIOP) setup the debugger hooks, portably.
#
# Things it won't do (yet):
# * support a non-standard quicklisp installation rather than the
# builtin ~/quicklisp or ~/.quicklisp. It's a SMOP to add (see e.g. how
# the source-registry is handled), but still has to be done. I believe
# ${x#*=} is a standard enough shell construct that one could give an
# argument to --quicklisp with --quicklisp=foo.
# * same for output translation — though you can already export the
# environment variable.
